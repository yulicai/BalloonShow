It feels like Michigan, it is a very cold spring, in April it was cold still, in May it snows, It just like really really cold all the time, snow like 5 inches, very cold, very overcast, no sun ever, and summer is just like right away.

Contradictory feeling, because I don't feel bleak at all because it is Spring. The idea of Spring makes me think that things are going to grow again, or like nice things are going to happen soon. Because I have always had this idea that summer is the best things happen and spring is before summer, thinking the bleak spring sounds very contradictory, like if you tell me this bleak fall, then yeah. But I also referring a lot of whether that associate the word, where I grow up, spring is always warmer, and spring is before summer, and summer is the happiest thing. So thinking about this being bleak is like no this can not happen.

Its like that color, its yellow green but it has no saturation, muted, yellow green, like you are waiting for all you flowers to bloom but they never did, its just like that ugly color.
