1950s americana, rock belie pink winctic in the back, like the things in the back seat, people exclaim but no one says it anymore. heaven is a weird thing, I went to a catholic school for 13 year but I am not religious, my family are not, I grow up in a pretty liberal place. Even though I don't believe in god for a long time but I still assume there is a heaven and hell, the idea of heaven and hell is just a part of any other religions, I could not believe in god but still believe in heaven and hell, I have to train myself that this is what happened when I am dead, I don't believe in heaven or hell.

It makes me think of beaches, it makes me think of be with people I really love, yeah, natural beauty, places in the world that I traveled, take my breath away, sunset for sure, very worldly thing, I guess because I'm not a very religious person, I don't think of beauty on. I think of the world rather then anything spiritual. It makes me think of red and orange, those sunset color, like really really bright and pink. The color of sunset actually.

I think that when people come to understand what they are doing in their lives and understand who they want to spend their lives with. Coming to a realisation of where they are, its like heaven, because it feels like complete.

Think of home, family, think of love, think of my girlfriend, music. I think of a lot of people, not like alone, it is like a social thing. I am in the centre of the people. I think of unity like holds you hand. Almost like the invisible energy that ties everything together. Acceptance. I think of like purple and pink the smell of like fresh cut grass and sweet things.
