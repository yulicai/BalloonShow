I don't know. Sounds like something in Shakespeare, like old english writing.

If I open my eyes, its like a nice emotion. I could actually, like in a forest with a lot of rivers, I feel that it is also something that comes to your mind when you discover something new and you feel your brain is open. Its like branching out, I get that feeling when I learn something new, its actually a really good feeling, I can see a painting in a wall. Its like stars keep opening, opening opening up, if you keep learning stuff and you keep discovering the world I feel that be like opening and opening even more.

I think of foot field by the forest in my high school, we used to play football every week, there is river goes there, and I think of the green color, the football field is down the hill the river is going on the left side, so we would play a little bit and run to the river and then run back, there is a forest in the background.


That sounds nice. It makes me think of campaign in upstate new york or probably anywhere, just being in the nature and not having computers and cellphones.I will probably with other people. I don't think I would like to be in the nature by myself. Maybe I would but campaign I feel like it is a fun group activity. And it also like be myself would be oh my god, it is like survival. But being with friends you are all like making food, carrying stuff, feel like less dangerous too, more safe. Trips with friends. It is usually very fun and relaxing getting away from your normal life of all the business and stress and breath in fresh air. I have been on a few campaign trips with my friends. We took a RV and drove from LA to big sirt which is a big park in California along the water. It is super beautiful and no cellular reception there. So you can't call anyone or look at the internet. We just camped out of this big car. It's different.
