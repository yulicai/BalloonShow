hesitation, maybe I want to say something but I didn't say it or I didn't do it, this is like to remind myself, its now or never,  a feeling of like two people walking, pass with each other, and then its gone, that moment you should say something. Think of two dots, top to bottom and bottom to top, its only a moment that they meet. They won't meet again, even if they meet again it wont be the same moment then.  maybe they won't meet again. hard to meet that moment again. Feel very fast, if you capture it or not.

It makes me think of meeting strangers in everyday life. They coming across, random people having random conversation with people you don't know. Unless you are in a situation with friends or people who know you guys mutually. There is no reason to be like "hey, let us hang out let us keep in touch after this. Even though in you head, like when you are in a bar and you had a really good conversation with a stranger, but then it is like do I want to keep in touch or no is this like a one time conversation or like maybe we will run into each other in the future. Just makes me think of happen sense interactions with strangers. Even though with some of my friend or my family that you don't see each other that often. It does not feel like that they are too far. If I really want to I can talk to them or see them. Like people who are closer, I don't know, they are always there you know, it feels like you can always rely on them so it does not feel like it is hard to meet again if you really want to. I am also lucky because most of my friends or family are in this country. But there could be barriers like time or money.
