garden and lake, like a lot of flowers, very healthy looking nature, like green and orange, a lot of movements going on, its not static, its actually really windy, flowers going everywhere, a bunch of butterfly? the grass, it feel really open, happy and free, rainbow? its feel like you are in a hurry, this state doesn't stay for a long time. Its not constant, this is the moment we will go away. Its not usually goes on all the time. there is nobody, no people, mostly nature and me.

Its like a field with like a stream, with flower paddle just flying everywhere. It reminds me of when I went to Mont Shasta in California. My friend has a cabin, we used to go up there when I was in California like in Spring in Summer, we just hang out there, he has a giant, 300 arches that we just wondered around, he has a field with a bunch of flowers, they have a stream. Summer time or Spring, its like really windy and flowers flying everywhere. Happy feeling that something I enjoyed. Was like getting away from living in the city and going to a place in a middle of nowhere. no cellphone acceptation, being in the nature, disconnected.

bad paintings, very boring paintings, boring painting lilies and lotus flower against the water, they are not bad, landscape portrait, its pretty but it is not telling me anything, usually is very literal, monet painting, pink flowers, lili pads, lakes and ponds, it also reminds me of a wedding for some reason, the flower girl she is walking forward and throwing the flower in air, paddles more than the flowers itself. I guess is also because the valentines days that the paddles on the paddler seems to be a pain in the ass to clean out.
