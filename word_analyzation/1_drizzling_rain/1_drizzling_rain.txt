It's like when you are inside and its so warm and you know its so awful out, you can't even open the curtains, you can hear the rain before you can see it, or sometimes you can just feel the cold before you can see what is like outside, you just stay in, you feel the dred from outside comes through the wall, its like the rain starts to come inside and grey. Every shade of grey, it like anxiety for me of reading it, when it gets very gross outside I don't want to leave the house, but I usually have stuff to do so I have to go out to do that but I don't want to, I hate the rain I would rather walk on the snow then the rain.

Sometimes I feel like really excited about it, when its inside and its raining outside, it almost feels like if time kind of stop, I need to do all the things that I usually do, because its raining, I don't have to get outside. So I get to this calm and excited feeling how I am going to spend this day, I am imagine that I'm gonna do this things that I never do. If I have to go to work or something, like I have to, I feel sad. Sometimes I works harder, its like a nicer energy, I feel like the energy when it is raining, it can be sometimes nice, but sometimes when it rains too much, then sometimes I really want the sun, but when the sun is out, you have no excuses, you have to do things, but then I feel wanna to go out for dinner, but it is raining I would be I don't really want to.
